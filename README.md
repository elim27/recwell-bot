# IsTheNickFull

## Description
IsTheNickFull is a Twitter bot that informs users on the current occupancy of The Nick (a recwell center at UW-Madison).
Due to the building's 25% capacity rule, the building's occupancy usually hovers around 100% with lines out the door
and it can be frustrating to constantly check the facility's live usage since it's always at 100% (so it seems). 
This bot aims to automate that process of checking the facility's usage and notify users when the building has an acceptable
amount of users.
